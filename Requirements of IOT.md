- To see the Success of IOT we need some requirement of that enables smooth interaction between devices , network and application 
- So the Major Requirement of IOT are

	1. Unique Identification of Devices
		   - Every device in IOT must have a unique identity(UID, IP Adderess or RFID tag).
		   - This ensures tracking and secure communication 
		     
	2. Connectivity and Network Infrastructure 
		- IoT requires stable connectivity using technology like WiFi, Bluetooth , LoRa etc 
		- Device must communicate with standard protocol like MQTT, HTTPS etc
		  
	3. Data Management and Processing 
		- IoT generate large amount of real time data
		- this requires data collection, storage and analysis.
	
	4. Security
	5. Energy Efficiency 
	6. Quality of Services (Q)
